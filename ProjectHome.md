jCPE is an open source implementation of a CPE WAN Management Protocol client, as described by the TR-069 v1.1 standard developed by the Broadband Forum (formerly the DSL Forum).

The long term goal of the project is to create a high-performance client. It will provide an implementation of the data models described in TR-106 and TR-098.

I am sorry, jCPE is no longer actively developed.
